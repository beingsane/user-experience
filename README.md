Joomla! User Experience Working Group (JUX)
====================
The mission of the Joomla! User Experience Working Group (JUX) is to continually improve user experience, usability and accessibility across all areas of the Joomla! CMS platform.

This project area is a central working area for contributors to the JUX team and ongoing JUX team projects. We are still in the process of creating detailed project and contributor guidelines.

If you have questions or would like more information about contributing to the JUX team, please contact [Cliff Pfeifer](https://volunteers.joomla.org/joomlers/316-cliff-pfeifer)
