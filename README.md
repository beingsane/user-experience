Joomla! User Experience Working Group (JUX)
====================

JUX Mission Statement
---------------------
* The mission of the Joomla! User Experience Working Group (JUX) is to continually improve user experience, usability and accessibility across all areas of the Joomla! CMS platform.

* Joomla! users are a globally diverse group, with diverse backgrounds and objectives. Each user perspective is uniquely valuable and we consider the input of every user equally, openly and objectively in our process. While individual user input continually shapes our process, our work is focused on improvements which provide a general benefit to the overall platform and user community.

* We encourage a positive culture of teamwork, collaboration and participation. We respect the diversity of our community, as well as the work of all previous, current and future Joomla! contributors. Our efforts embody the spirit of Joomla! and our actions reflect the mission and values of the Joomla project at all times.
